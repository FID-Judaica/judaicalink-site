Links between JudaicaLink entities.
<!--more-->

This is only a very preliminary example for entity linking. This dataset so far contains only links between [Rujen](/datasets/rujen) and [Yivo](/datasets/yivo).

The links are created based on [DBpedia](http://www.dbpedia.org/), i.e., if two entities are linked to the same DBpedia concept (potentially via different language editions), they are considered the same.
